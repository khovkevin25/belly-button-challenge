# belly-button-challenge

## Kevin Khov

In this challenge, we took samples of bacteria and created interactive charts using JavaScript. For the challenge, the list of samples used can be found in the "samples.json" file, the interactive charts can be found in the "index.html" file, and the code used to create the charts can be found in the "static" folder under "app.js".
